### Krushi-Mitra

• Traditional methods of pest management often involve the widespread application of pesticides, which can be
both costly and environmentally damaging. Our application will use an AI/ML model that recommends specific
pesticides based on the identification of pests in images which enables more precise and targeted pest control
strategies.

• We have created a 4000+ pest image dataset. The model will result in an accuracy of 80 percent.

• Technology: AI/ML (Yolov8), Html, Css, Js, Sveltekit
